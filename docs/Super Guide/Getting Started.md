## Installing Mod Tools

You need to own [Black Ops 3 on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/), this is the only way to own a PC version of the game.

Then go to your Steam Library → Tools → Call of Duty: Black Ops III - Mod Tools and install.

You may also want to install extra assets which include more models and textures. On the same page as installing the mod tools, right click them Properties → DLC → BOIII Mod Tools - Additional Assets and tick the "INSTALL" box. ADDITIONAL ASSETS IS ABOUT 50GB IN SIZE. Video Guide by JBird

A desktop shortcut can be created when installing but use any methods you like to quick access the tools. If you would like to access a single program from within the tools, such as Radiant Black - the level design software, go to your Black Ops 3 "root folder" (default C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III), modtools_launcher can be found here if you wish to make a shortcut to that, then go into bin where you can also find modlauncher, export2bin, Radiant_modtools and all other applications in BO3 Mod Tools

## Other Software

If you wish to do scripting, a text editor is required, preferably one which is dedicated to scripting. E.g. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.html)

2D Art and Texture creation will require software, this can be done in any image editing software and to an extent in modern text editors:

* Free → [Gimp 2](https://www.gimp.org/); [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/) - online editor with many features; [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/.html) - do not get confused with MS Paint, this is way more advanced and was very useful in WaW Modding; see more free software [here](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/best-free-photo-editing-software-10-top-image-editors-you-should-try-1135489) and decide which suits your needs.

* Paid → [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html); [Microsoft Office Package](https://products.office.com/en-gb/home) - the likelihood of you having access to some features of this package are fair; in some of the software, images can be moved around, grouped, layers changed. Shapes and text can also be edited.

3D Modelling software - use paid (free for 3 years for students) [Maya](http://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) or free [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Animations can also be made in these softwares.

Audio Editing - use free [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)

Video Editing (maybe for cutscenes or trailers) - use any: [Sony Vegas](http://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/?utm_source=sonycreativesoftware&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=redirect&lang=us&prdt=vegassoftware) - advanced; [Windows Movie Maker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/14220/windows-movie-maker-download) - basic; [Adobe Premiere](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html?kw=semgeneric&sdid=JRSJD&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!75262030850!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere&ef_id=V4FMxgAAB6I-NWDF:20161011103710:s) - advanced.
